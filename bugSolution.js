To address the asynchronous nature of Firebase operations, we need to ensure that user data is accessed only after the authentication state is fully resolved and user data is successfully retrieved from the database.

```javascript
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(async user => {
  if (user) {
    try {
      const dbRef = firebase.database().ref('users/' + user.uid);
      const snapshot = await dbRef.once('value');
      const userData = snapshot.val();
      console.log(userData);  //Access user data after successful retrieval
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching user data:', error);
    }
  } else {
    // Handle the case where the user is not logged in.
  }
});
```
This improved code uses `async/await` to ensure the data access happens only after the database promise resolves, preventing potential errors.
